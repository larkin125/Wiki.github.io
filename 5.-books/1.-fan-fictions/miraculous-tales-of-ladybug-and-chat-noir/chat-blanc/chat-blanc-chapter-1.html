I’ve always loved you and yet I’ve never been able to say it since we first met?’” Adrien spoke as he made a speaking motion with his hand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“You just need to be more confident Adrien, once you are, Ladybug will be talking to you more” he laughed softly while chowing down on the cheese.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“I try Plagg but…” he never finished his sentence as ring vibrated. That meant he was getting a call from Ladybug, so quickly looked around his room, checking it was clear before transforming.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Plagg, Claws out!” he called out. Once he was done transforming he checked his staffs phone.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Hey Chat, where are ya? We go a villain to fight!” she looked like she was dodging shots as she jumped from rooftop to rooftop.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“On my way my pretty little buggy boo” he giggled softly and jumped out the window.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"> ~ Several hours later ~ </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Laughing and waving to Ladybug, Cat Noir smirked and bowed to her with a sudden wink. Dashing across the rooftop and pounding on all fours, he dived into the old phone box and changed back. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Damn that was a good fight Plagg," He held out his shirt and let his Kwami dive inside and take the cheese waiting for him there.  Heading back home and trying to get some attention from his father, failing as usual, Adrien headed up to his room. Sure he'd missed all the day's school work after being on his way from a photo shoot but he could always find a way to revise; he had been home schooled for many years so it wasn't that hard.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">His fathers assistant explained that a student could possibly help him with missing the day so he went through the facebook list of the school students in his class.  His other friends were no in the class today or were in other classes, so he had to look through others he'd not really talk to. "Hmm, Marinette is pretty smart... " he then began to type a message.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Hey Marinette. I missed school today, do you think you can help me catch up with some work?."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Oh hey Adrien! Um yeah sure I could help you! If you really wanted... And Yeah..." She typed wondering if that was casual enough to at least not weird him out.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Awesome" he replied, sitting at the vastly expensive computer, he looked around the several screens; it wasn't too late today and it was the weekend after all, so he could go around any time. He knew where Marinette lived after going there as both Adrien and Cat Noir.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"What time do you want me to come around? I can come now or tomorrow? If you're not busy. I have a photo shoot tomorrow again, We can do the homework and stuff then if you want, come with me to the shoot and after I'll get you something from the sweet store as a thank you!" </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"That makes it sound like a date Adrien." Plagg laughed softly and Adrien turned to him quickly. "Oh it does... I don't want her thinking that... it sounds weird doesn't it...I'll add something." To which he added.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"For being a good friend! I'll grab my things and be over soon" he smiled to himself and stood up, unaware of the freak out she was having. He collected his books, some clothes for the next day and the clothes he'd be wearing for the photo shoot. Adding a vast amount of beauty products to his duffel bag for the photo shoot; he was going to be doing this for one of France's most famous magazines after all.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Leaving his house, he snuck out and headed out to Marinette's place. Walking through the streets, it was quite late at night and her was quite sure that it was way too late for Hawk Moth to attempt to Akumatize someone again, hopefully.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Arriving at Marinette’s place, he knocked on the door and was greeted by the tall and wide frame of her father. “Hello Mr Dupain, I’m here to study with Marinette. I missed school today so she said she would be helping me” he grinned softly and shuffled his duffel bag on his shoulder “Hope its okay?” he added softly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Oh Adrien, it’s perfectly fine, just, no funny business up there, it is late and boys are not usually allowed in her room” Marinette’s father teased, leaving Adrien with a slight blush on his cheeks.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Trust me Mr Dupain, I’m not that kind of person” he tried to grin, leaving her father laughing. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Come on in then Adrien, would you like a drink?” he asked as the pair entered through the shop.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Going up to Marinette’s room, he found her panting and holding closed a large storage chest. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Hey Marinette, thanks for the help” he came up through the trap door and put down the duffel bag on the sofa in one corner before pulling out his notebooks, tablet and work books.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“No pro..prob problem Adrien! Any time you need help… You can just ask me, because… I’ll be here to help… when you ask… for my help… I’ll be here!” she grinned and stammered over herself.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">s“I was thinking we start with Math, then move onto History?” he asked softly as he looked up, Marinette always had a flush on her face when he spoke to her, it was almost as if she had a crush on him. He couldn’t help but chuckle at that thought; it couldn’t be.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so for the next few hours Adrien and Marinette worked together to get through both their homework, Marinette helping Adrien with his missed classes and Adrien even helping her with some of her homework.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Looking at his watch. “Wow, its almost Ten PM, I didn’t realise that it would be this late” He chuckled softly and relaxed back on the sofa, running a hand over his face. Marinette’s parents had brought pastries up from the store with drinks.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Yea, it is rather late. Do you… perhaps… maybe want to… stay overnight?” she asked and Adrien nodded.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Sure thing, I do have a photo shoot in the morning that I have to go to, as I said earlier, and you can come along if you wish to” he suggested and she suddenly grinned so wide and almost giggled so much.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Yes… Yes… I would love to go to a photo shoot with you!” she giggled and then coughed and added “It would be nice. Yes… Let me go tell my parents, there is a fold out bed in the sofa, if you pull it out, I’ll grab your quilt and pillows” she got up quickly and shot off downstairs.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“She seems happy” Plagg whispered and Adrien shushed him quickly, not wanting to get spotted just yet.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Once Marinette came back with the bed covers and the pillows, she helped Adrien pull out the bed and get everything set up. Walking downstairs to the bathroom, she giggled to herself.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Oh my god! Adrien is staying in my house! Sleeping in my room!” she giggled and Tikki chuckled softly. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“You need to be careful Marinette, if he finds out I’m here, something serious could happen and what happens if Hawk Moth or an Akumatized villain appears? You will have to try and sneak out” Tikki warned and let Marinette stop hyperventilating before smiling and hiding in her pocket again.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Marinette had made sure to hide the pictures and posters of Adrien from her walls so he wouldn’t find it. A knock came from the door and Marinette left the bathroom. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Mind if I change?” he asked softly and she quickly jumped out of his way before going up to her room to organise her bed for the night, they wouldn’t be sleeping yet and would hang out before bed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrien came out wearing just a pair of boxer shorts and carried his clothes in his arms neatly folded. Marinette almost had an aneurysm as she stared at Adrien’s bare body.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Oh my oh my oh my oh my” she muttered and quickly turned away with a blush. “Adrien is partly naked in my room… have I died and gone to heaven?” she wondered out loud.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Want to watch some TV or play some games? I know you’re the best but I’m sure I can give it a try to beat you?” he asked with a chuckle and pulled up a chair beside her. With her deep red face, she picked up the controller and began to play with him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrien knew what he was doing, she was clearly embarrassed by having a boy over and was trying to make her feel relaxed. Playing the games with her was fun and soon, she began to get competitive once she began to lose to him a bit.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">By the time it was time for bed, she was laughing and enjoying the time together without her awkward shy blushing and eye avoidance.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Good Night Adrien” Marinette spoke after turning the light off and getting into bed, having changed into her night clothes; a pair of shorts and an old T-shirt.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Good Night Milady” He teased and she laughed softly before the pair got into their beds. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Something nagged at Marinette that wouldn’t let her sleep. The way he had said Milady made her think of Chat Noir but… why would he say that? It wasn’t something normal and unusual for Adrien, although it was jokey and they had been laughing and messing around with each other.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrien cursed himself for calling her that, he’d slipped into Chat Noir mode and began to relax around Marinette a little too much and slipped out something Chat Noir would say. He’d need to watch his words next time or when out of his suit.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This kept the pair awake some time, however Marinette was awake because she could not get over Adrien sleeping less than five feet from her. </p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
