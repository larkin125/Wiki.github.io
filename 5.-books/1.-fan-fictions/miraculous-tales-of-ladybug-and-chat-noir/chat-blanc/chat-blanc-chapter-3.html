You look like you are not happy, perhaps your out of breath, here… let me give you some" Chat Noir grinned, starting to lean in closer.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ladybug looked him in the eye and before he got close, placed a finger up and creating some distance between them "That's sweet of you but, I prefer to breathe my own air, thanks."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I dont know, my air is much sweeter."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Mm, I'll just take your word for it. Who knows who else has breathed that air."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"My air is only for you my lady..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Such a waste then since I'm passing it up."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It is, my heart aches... my soul passes into the night..." Noir held his chest and reached out his hand into the sky.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"For it is in need of love and care... lest I fall into ever-reaching darkness..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A deep sigh escaped her lips, watching such a dramatic display. "Ugh! I'm pulling the curtain!" Offers a hand. "If you need something to put your lips on, you can settle for this."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You know.. I'm starting to think maybe you don't like me Ladybug.." Chat Noir sighed, leaning forward and kissing her hand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Maybe Queen Bee would appreciate my affection, or even Rena Rouge..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It's not that. I...I told you, it's complicated. Why do you keep being so pouty about it and bringing it into things?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Rena Rouge definitely wouldn't go for you and as for Chloe, she's definitely not your type. So, how about you forget about romance and focus on saving Paris, yeah?" After his kiss, her hand lifted and her finger stroked beneath his chin.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Oh I have a type now?" He asked with a sly smile. "Maybe she is my type. I've actually known her for quite a while. You'd be surprised how sweet Chloe Bourgeois can be." He winked before looking at her when she fingered his chin.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Maybe I'd like a little romance in the city of love, after all, we save it enough times..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"She can be a decent person, sure. But wouldn't dating her be too much of an emotional roller coaster for a sensitive kitty like you?" She crosses her arms. "Plus, we've already gotten her into enough drama now that everyone knows she's not only the mayor's daughter but also a superhero. Let her work on herself before you go rushing into things with her."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A soft smile forced its way upon her lips, despite how much she wished to fight it off. "It's not that I don't want to give you a chance and you know that."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I could make it work, you don't know my real identity. Maybe I'm a bit of a famous person anyway.."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You like someone else?" He asked with a sigh. "It's fine.. I know when a better man has won." He raised his hands and then looked out into the distance.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Come on.. lets go find whatever trouble's popped up." He ran to the edge of the building and pounced into the air</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"W-Wait up!" With a groan, she grappled onto the next building and caught up with him. "A famous person, huh? Well then, if you're so popular, maybe we know each other."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">His words made her feel guilty for some reason. She wasn't sure why but beneath her denial, it was clear that her heart was torn between Chat Noir and Adrien but she could never admit that. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"But don't go rushing into things without me. It's better to form a plan if we're together."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrien ran along, occasionally switching to all fours to pounce across rooftops and high chimneys.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Yea, I'm very famous. You could say.." He jumped and landed on a large TV, the billboard switched to Agreste fashion, a large image of a half naked Adrien in a pair of swimming trunks, showing off the new brand and its appropriate aftershave.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You could say I'm as famous as this nerd." He motioned to the image of Adrien.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Seeing the billboard photo caused her to blush and stare for a long few moments. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Wow... I didn't know he did a new ad." She was definitely looking that up when she got home. Maybe that's why he didn't invite her to that photo shoot. It would've been a little awkward for him. Her daze was rudely interrupted by Chat Noir's words, causing Ladybug to place her hands on her hips.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Adrien Agreste is NOT a nerd! He's totally flawless~ I doubt you're even close to being as cool as him."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"He's flawless?" He grinned, he'd been called a number of things but flawless was not one of them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"He has plenty of flaws, you realise I know him right? Known him for quite a few years." Chat Noir winked over at her.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I know him so much that I know he has a little birthmark right here..." He tapped a point just below the waistline of the swim trunks. "Go ahead.. ask him about it the next time you see him."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">She grinned smugly. "I know him, too. He says we're actually really good friends."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"H-He has a birthmark....where!?!" She turned bright red as her imagination went places. "That's not a flaw! It's probably adorable. Just like the rest of him. AND I CANNOT ASK HIM ABOUT THAT! " She averted her gaze from the photo now that her eyes couldn't help from trying to burn a hole into his swim trunks each time she looked.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Just ask him..." He smiled at her, slowly walking around the rooftop after jumping up.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It's in an old photo of him, they actually forgot to edit it out." He admitted. "Look up his first swimwear photo shoot, its right there in the middle of his little happy trail.." He laughed softly, pointing to a spot on his own body where he knew he had the little birth mark.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Rather cute too... if I say so myself. " He laughed softly. "Oh... and I know that he shaves his entire body for photo shoots but leaves a little bit of hair for his happy trail.." He joked, seeing her reaction to it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I think I worked out who you like..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You know some pretty personal details, Chat Noir. Either you're a creepy stalker or..... you must be a relative, right?" Her denial was so deep. "But there is no way I'm asking him about it! What kind of girl asks a question that gives away that she stares at his body nearly nude?" She walked a bit away from the revealing and tempting billboard and continued to pretend not to be imagining things while looking out for any trouble.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Yeah, I guess you have but, you don't seem as upset about it as I thought you'd be. Then again, I never thought you'd start describing the details of his body to me either."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I know a lot about him, we're close." He told her, "but to prove it, I will get you a date."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You know what.. tomorrow's Friday, Adrien's supposed to have Chinese class but its cancelled. Go to the Le Jules Verne, the restaurant on the Eiffel Tower. Your love will be there for you." He told her.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"A better man has won you over Ladybug... I'm a gentleman and know when to give in." He bowed slowly, walking over. "All I ask, is a kiss?" He asked softly, gentlemanly, actually not being flirty.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"R-Really!?! A date!? Wait, is this really a good idea? I-I mean, there was one girl that was with him in a lot of pictures online and everyone assumed they were in a relationship when they weren't. I don't want rumours to start swirling for him. He's got enough to deal with." She sighed. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If he saw who she really was, he'd probably just see it as the two of them going out to dinner as friends.... and if she goes as Ladybug, then the press will eat them alive. "This is a disaster..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">His question snapped her out of her spiralling thoughts. "You're still asking for a kiss? You're so relentless, kitty. Well, I've kissed you once, one more for no hard feelings won't be so bad, right?" She leaned forward with her eyes shut.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"There will be rumours, there are always rumours around him and us... I mean, we're heroes' and he's France's biggest rising model star. But... he will be there. For a date, in one of Paris' most expensive and romantic restaurants. You do not have to go in your suit and stuff, but I think if you do; it will be better. After all, our identities have to remain hidden." Noir explained.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"If he tells me he went out with a girl, and I find out who it is, then I know your identity." he laughed softly. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It will be fine..." He told her and looked her in the eyes. "This will be the last time I ask, because you're now going to be dating someone." He leaned in and gave her a soft peck, not a romantic kiss, not a loving kiss. Just a peck on the lips.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"That will have to be my burden to bear now." He put his hand on his heart and smiled.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I tried my hardest and I lost to a better man." he nodded and stood up straight. "I'll go tell him. You take care." Noir ran off and made a long journey to his house, where he transformed back.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He had a date with Ladybug. A huge grin on Adrien's face appeared, it was a low trick but it was different. He was Adrien with her, not Chat Noir.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At school the next day, the Friday of the date, he was smiling as he walked in to class</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"That's the problem..." If she went as Ladybug, no one would find out who she was but, then the internet will go insane with the new couple of Ladybug and Adrien Agreste. The only real option she had was to go as herself since there were already rumours of he and Marinette dating and it wouldn't be news to anyone. He had her... But at least she could trust Chat Noir to keep a secret, even if this date did cause Adrien to reveal her secret identity to him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Chat Noir's kiss wasn't like she'd expected but, she couldn't dwell on that when that entire night was spent tossing, turning and talking things over with Tikki. She was against the reveal but she claimed that ultimately, it was Marinette's decision. That didn't help at all. "If I stand him up, Chat Noir will ice me out again and be all pouty that I didn't come to something he planned! But if I go, then he'll find out who I am! UGH! Why can't I just say no? I'm so lame! It's because it's Adrien. I can't turn down Adrien! He's like, the definition of perfect!" She rambled on and on as she sat at her desk and fidgeted with her sewing supplies while Tikki did her best to reassure her while also reminding her of the gravity of such a situation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The next day at school, she was so tired that she had to stop at the nurse's office during study hall to take a nap. Marinette couldn't sleep that night and her stomach was in knots each time she passed by the grinning boy in the hallway. He looked so happy.
