In fact Alya came to Marinette with a "Did you know Adrien's got a date with Ladybug?! He say's Chat Noir set it up. We have to ruin the date." She obviously wanted to get Marinette in there instead. A good friend, to ruin a date to put someone else there!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Eiffel tower was closed off, it seemed that no one was allowed up. There were people complaining at the base and even some rich men and woman complaining that their reservation was cancelled.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Chat Noir had sent Ladybug a message via their devices and it was a pass code to the man outside. He had no idea who Adrien was meeting but let her in if she used it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If she did come up the lift, the entire restaurant was booked out, no one else was there apart from Adrien Agreste.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sat in the middle of the main seats, right in the best spot of the revolving windows, he tapped his fingers at the table in front of him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Hello?" He called out. There was a reason why he hadn't moved.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He was wearing a blindfold. A blace silk blindfold that hid any chance for him to peek outside of it. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"If that is you Ladybug, you do not have to worry about being spotted here, I've booked out the place for us; it was expensive but... I wanted to do it to save you from being embaressed or spotted. I have also wore a blindfold so if you are in your real form, you are not revealed to me. It would be dangerous for that." He told her with a soft smile, a caring smile. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Chat Noir told me that you... well... you wanted to have a date iwth me. I admit I was excited." He continued, speaking even though he could have just been talking to an empty room if it had just been a simple noise he'd heard.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I've wanted to have a date with you for a long time. I've... well... I've had a crush on you since you first appeared." He laughed softly to himself.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I know its silly, a boys-crush but... I did." He looked down, rubbing his hands. "Someone like me, a rich boy with so wealth and fame, I could have anyone I wanted... but.. I wanted you." He admitted, going all out in his opening speech.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"There are a lot of girls who like me, a lot of guys too. I know that. Some of them in my school. Chloe, well she's very firm in her appreciation... then you have people like Marinette." He continued, unaware that marinette was stood there. "The poor girl's so nervous around me. I'd be stupid not to notice. Nino and Alya and all our friends try to get me to tell her but I couldn't break her heart... I couldn't tell her that I have eyes for you Ladybug." He admitted. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He admitted he knew about Marinette's crush, he admitted people had told him too, he admitted he didn't want to hurt her.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I like her, she's a nice girl... I like Chloe, she's a nice girl too, sometimes... Hell, I like a lot of people at my school. But..." he turned his head to try and look right at her with the blindfold.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I... I love you more... Ladybug.." There was a silence for a second before he spoke.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Please tell me I didn't just confess to an empty room.. or a waiter..."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When Marinette arrived, the place was empty besides the two of them and what's more was that...he was blindfolded. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"He's so sweet," she gushed softly to herself before walking over to him. In a way, she was grateful he was so considerate, especially after he spoke of her like he could never love her in comparison to his feelings for Ladybug. Marinette had to bite her lip in order to avoid sighing from the sudden heartbreak. Everyone else seemed to love Adrien for his looks and his status but, while those things were nice, she liked him because he was kind and considerate as well as talented and empathetic.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Adrien, that was beautiful." She took his hand in order to let him know she was there. Hopefully since she wasn't wearing gloves, the little bumps in her skin from constantly being pricked with a sewing needle didn't give her away. She sat down across from him, still resting her hand on his. He'd gone through all the trouble just to make this a safe date that wouldn't get ruined by anyone else. Even though he'd totally just obliterated her heart as Marinette, she had to go on as Ladybug...To make him happy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You're amazing and your kind heart has always spoken volumes to me without really having a chance to get close to you. I think it's sweet that you love me but, I'm not sure we can work out like this. My identity will be compromised every time we meet up." She scratched her cheek, wondering what to suggest.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I have a question for you. If....If I did go to school with you when I'm not Ladybug, would your opinion of me change or would you still love me? And....You'd keep that secret if you ever found out. I know that. I'm just not sure if we should make a habit of this."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Listening, feeling her, his heart jumped. He actually twitched as he felt her take his hand and move to sit down. It was strange to be blindfolded like this but it was what he had done to make it safe for her. He did not want to scare her away. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Thank you Ladybug. I... well.. Its hard being me, I know you're a superhero and its hard for you too, but being rich... being a model... it is hard. People don't think that it is but when you can't even go to your trash can without having sixteen people take pictures of you and your rubbish, before having a six page expose on the fact I smell of Cheese all the time.. its hard." He nodded slowly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">His voice faltered as he spoke a little more, his hand had twitched when she said that she was not sure it would work out. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In his mind, he was rather angry. That he'd sacrificed his love as Chat Noir for her and here she was telling him it may not work out?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He took a deep breath, calming his beating heart.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It would be hard for any secret to be around me." He admitted. "People find out things about me. I've had my phone hacked eight times since Monday morning." He admitted. "I keep six different phones on me at any one time. My Facebook profile is fake, I have another called "McBoaty Mc'Boat face... " He laughed softly. Only people at school knew his fake profile, in fact it had been Alya and Nino who made it for him specifically for Marinette to spy on it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"My love would never change for you Ladybug, but I do not know if I could keep your secret because... anything around me just.. gets out. Hell.." He looked down and pulled his shirt up a little, revealing his little happy trail by pulling his trousers a little.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Chat Noir even found out about this." He motioned to the little birth mark across his stomach, tiny but there it was, right where Chat Noir said it was. It was in the shape of a paw.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I know how hard it is. I see it everyday. That's why I don't get upset when I don't see you at a party or when everyone is spending time together. You've got a stressful life and I'd never want to make that worse. I might admire you from afar but, the only thing I want is for you to be happy, not constantly having to worry about being the reason for your girlfriend's secret identity being exposed."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When he spoke the name of the profile she'd been watching, she reached up and rubbed her head. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Hehe... Yeah... What a ridiculous name. I-I bet that even with that, it's hard to be you. At least with me, I can keep my identity secret and avoid my privacy being invited... I....I mean the rumour was that you had a date with Ladybug so, I'm risking my privacy by being here without my costume right now. If we're alone and only you find out then...Maybe we could start a relationship. But there will always be a risk."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Exposing his birth mark had caused a gasp to escape from her lips. "I was right! It IS adorable! I-I MEAN, wow. Chat Noir was telling the truth about that...."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Thank you." He smiled and relaxed back, slowly trying to find his water with his free hand, sipping it and not spilling it before putting it down.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"No one here knows I'm on a date with Ladybug, the staff here think I'm dating an important girl, that's it." He smiled. "I think it was Alya and Nino who began to spread it. I mean, Alya doesn't stop to put anything on her lady-blog, even if it does involve me." He admitted, he didn't hate them for it, but it had been annoying.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Then again, I was smiling all day, I did day dream and admit I had a date with someone. I think I might have hurt people's feelings..." He looked down before looking back at her.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You're taking the biggest risk here, I did not mind if you came in your outfit, but it is nice to know you trusted me with your identity. I have one secret I've managed to keep, but I cannot tell anyone. It would hurt even you if I did." He explained. Grinning when she mentioned his birthmark, he laughed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Yea... it is adorable." He smiled. "But they edit it out in the photo's... I'm not perfect with it." he admitted, mimicking her words about 'being perfect' without realising it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"If you want to start a relationship, I will respect it. You can show me your identity but I cannot promise it would not get out. I would prefer that you keep as Ladybug. If people find out I'm dating Ladybug, then we are two famous people dating... but if, like.. you're actually Alya, or Rose, or Juleka... or any number of the girls in my school... or you turn out to be someone else and then get revealed... people will think or know you're Ladybug and that's not safe." He explained.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It's just not fair..." She pouted, resting her hand on her cheek. "Everyone knows Chloe's Queen Bee and she's already famous and super annoying." All the girls he'd mentioned weren't even her. He really had no idea, did he? "Besides, I can't be Rose, Juleka or Alya. They were all Akumatized, remember? So, I won't tell you but, I've never been Akumatized before." If he wanted to leave it a mystery, that was fine by her. She'd only shown up as herself because she didn't want people making up rumours about Ladybug to make more trouble for Adrien.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I don't mind dating you as Ladybug as long as you don't mind people trying to hunt me down and try to find me without my mask. I'd like to see them try to catch a superhero. Though, I think the fans that ship me with Chat Noir will be a little disappointed." She giggled.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I understand that there are some things you can't tell me about since you're famous and anything you tell anyone will go public so, I'll do my best not to get in the way." Hearing about his birth mark being edited out in pictures made her sad. What was wrong with a small blemish? It wasn't like a birth mark was considered an actual flaw. "I think you're even more perfect with it. I think it's unfair that they try to change you like that, even in such a small way."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There was a fresh glass of water beside her as well and she took a sip. "I can't believe you went through all of this trouble just to be with me. It's going to kill me knowing that I can't tell any of our friends I was on a date with you. They'd be so happy for me....But it's better this way."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Adrien smiled at her. "They were... Nino too.. you know.. Marinette and I are the only one's not to be Akumatized in our little group." He laughed softly. "Guess we're just lucky. But you can't be Marinette. She's too sweet and innocent to be Ladybug. No offence, but you're pretty scary at times." He laughed softly. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Marinette is one of the sweetest girls I know. She's strong like you, but it's a different type of strong." He nodded, unaware he was talking to Marinette.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He wasn't trying to be insulting to her, he thought Marinette couldn't be Ladybug because Marinette was, in his eyes, a lot stronger than Ladybug. She was a normal girl who did extraordinary things. Ladybug was a super hero doing super hero things.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"The only problem you'll have is people kidnapping me to get to you, or using me to get to you. I can handle that, don't worry. Its not the first time I've been kidnapped." He laughed softly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"The fashion industry is a hard place, they don't like imperfection, and my fans want me as their mind's image. Any little imperfection and it has to be erased. You might not know this but I've had plastic surgery when I was younger." he explained. "Little bit of alteration here... my teeth straightened when I was young... it's kept hidden by my father but yea... I'm not perfect. I'm just a little product made to look nice for the public" </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I went through this trouble for you because I know that it could be a problem if you were revealed. But yes, it is a shame you can't tell anyone. You can gloat to your Hero friends, in fact I'll let you announce it to the public when and where you want. So you don't have to worry about me revealing it."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I can't be Marinette, huh?" She grinned, willing herself not to prove him wrong. "Well, isn't that Marinette girl a bit on the clumsy side? She's not nearly as graceful as I am," she said, obviously holding back laughter. He was so oblivious. Then again, she couldn't judge. It was probably just as obvious who Chat Noir was. "Good to know that I'm scary sometimes. That'll probably come in handy one day."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I.... I can't let that happen. I can't have you getting kidnapped because of me. I don't care if you can handle it, I refuse to put you in danger, Adrien...." She hung her head, gazing down at the table as she contemplated her future. Either she reveals herself and puts them both in danger or Adrien constantly gets targeted by enemies to try and get her to give up her Miraculous. Either way, she loses.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"The fashion industry is pretty cut throat. I had no idea you had plastic surgery.... Just so you'd be cut out for modelling? That's horrible." Her heart ached for him. He'd been born and forced into a life of being judged and fixed up to meet everyone's expectations. He never had a chance to be a normal person. "I bet you didn't need all that. The real attractive thing about you is your personality. " </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">She shook her head. "I don't need to gloat that badly. As much as I'd love to, I'd wanna gloat because I like you, not because of your status. They'd all probably tease me for using my hero title to court famous models." She let out a small laugh, imagining the ridiculous possibilities of all of this. Only time would tell if it would work out or not.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Its fine Ladybug, I'm fine with being in danger, I mean. Have you met my father? I doubt anything would happen to me that he could stop. With you and him together, I'm invincible." He laughed quietly, slowly fingering his ring.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Plus, I can look out for myself." He added.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"But yea, the fashion industry is pretty dire. I'm the Heir to the Agreste dynasty; I need to be perfect. Have you seen my father when he first started?" He asked. "He was just like me, he had built this from the ground up, I can't ruin it for him and my family." He explained.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It wasn't that bad. " He pulled out his phone and swiped the gallery down to the very bottom.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He handed it to her without looking, it was photo's of him as a much younger boy, some that had never been seen. He looked... well... average. His teeth were normal apart from a few not grown right and were at an odd angle, changed to be his perfectly pearly whites. His nose had a slight curve but was now... perfect.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">His cheekbones were pretty much the same but his ears had been tucked back a little.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the photo he looked... well.. average. Nothing wrong. But average was not good enough in the modelling world.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Personality is nothing when people only care about looks. I mean, I'm glad that I was born with a big dick.." he laughed at the joke and smiled.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I guess its then official.. you and I are dating" He held out his hand. "Do I call you Milady or Princess?" He asked, referring to Chat Noir.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Looking at the pictures, she felt sorrowful and warm all at once. The way he looked before was still endearing. "You were so cute. I'd still be into you no matter what you looked like. And I know...Your father has a legacy to continue. I get it. I just don't agree with it." She set his phone down, immediately choking over his joke. "I-Is that so??" </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">She took his hand as he'd offered it. "You can call me whatever you'd like. You don't have to follow Chat Noir's example. He's a bit of an overly dramatic flirt." There was a laughter in her voice as she basked in the warmth of his hand. She was dating Adrien and he had no idea he was holding hands with Marinette but she'd save this for her dreams and her diary, despite how tragic this truly was.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I still don't like the idea of you getting targeted and I don't want that to happen....But if it does, I promise you, I'll protect you." She gave his hand a squeeze. "I'll just scare them into submission," she said, referencing what he'd said earlier.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"If you want to put your phone number into my phone. I can call you if I'm ever in trouble." He explained, "And I think I'll call you Girlfriend, that will work." He chuckled and waved his hand, a nearby waiter who had been waiting on a signal but not listening or watching came over with food. It was the best and most richest meals the place offered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Now enjoy your meal and we can then go out, maybe you can carry me and jump along the rooftops." He laughed after the waiter left.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
