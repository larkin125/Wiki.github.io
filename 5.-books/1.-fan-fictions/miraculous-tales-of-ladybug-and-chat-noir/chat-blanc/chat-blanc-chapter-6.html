He admitted. "Ladybug has started dating someone else and, well… I’m jealous." He admitted. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I... don't have anyone else to... well." He paused quietly. "Can... can I stay here tonight? I don't want to go home due to my room being filled with ladybug stuff and I don't really want to be alone tonight." He admitted quietly, shyly, totally not his style. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Plus... your nice to me." He added.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Well…" Marinette rubbed the back of her head nervously. "I..." She looked a little sad. The poor guy was jealous and just wanted some company. Being the compassionate person she was, she couldn't just turn him away. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Okay, you can stay but, you're sleeping on the floor," she said, flushing very subtly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"But, you don't have to be jealous. Maybe Ladybug just isn't the one. I'm sure there are lots of girls that want to date you, right?" She was at a slight loss for words. She walked over and sat down in her desk chair. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It's okay if you wanna talk about it, Chat Noir. I know what unrequited love is like. It's a lot of heartache that you don't let on."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I... I'm not jealous... well… I am… but…" He sighed, swinging upside down. "Its hard to explain.. if you knew who I was you'd understand." He sighed; swinging upside down by his belt tail.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was hard for him to think about it too, he shouldn't be jealous, he WAS dating Ladybug, but... Adrien was dating Ladybug, not him. When he was Adrien, he always felt like he had to put on a character; Chat Noir was more himself than his true identity.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He hated being Adrien, he had to do classes, he had to go do modelling jobs, he had to follow rules and had to be the 'perfect person'. Even when he was just acting normal around his friends, he still had to put on a persona.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But Chat Noir, he could do what he wanted, he could flirt and not worry about it, he could joke and laugh and act out whatever he wanted without any worry for ruining his fathers business.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Chat Noir wanted to date Ladybug because then he could do anything he wanted with her. Adrien dating Ladybug would always be in the news... they would be followed by paparazzi. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"No one really wants me. I told Ladybug that I had loads of people lining up to ask me out but... I don't." He sighed again. "I said that to make her a little jealous so she'd perhaps go out on a date with me." He admitted to her, not realising he was telling Ladybug everything.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"She has Adrien now, so its fine." He admitted, the first time anyone other than Adrien, Ladybug and Chat Noir had told anyone, unaware that she already knew because she WAS Ladybug.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He finally dropped from the ceiling, and just like his namesake, landed on all fours almost as if physics failed for him for a moment and he completely span around to land on them in the blink of an eye.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sitting cross legged on the floor, he looked at Marinette.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Sure people like me, but... they just think I'm a joker, a flirt and a laugh. Hell, this girl I know who is absolutely loving to me in my real identity hates me like this." He motioned to himself, referring to Chloe.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I guess you're the only person I know who doesn't look at me like I'm some hero, some celebrity." He admitted, "Well, atleast in this form you do." He mumbled, unaware that little slip might give her a clue to him being Adrien.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"In this form?" Great. Now she was curious. What could those words possibly mean? Did they know each other in real life too and not just as heroes? Shaking her head, she dismissed those questions. That was none of her business. Right now, she had a friend coming to her to vent and she needed to do what she could to help him work through this.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"So, you're jealous but at the same time, you want her to take you seriously enough to go on a date with you?" This was giving her a whole new perspective on the way she acted as Ladybug. She hadn't meant to be cold or ignore his feelings toward her and she knew what it was like to only be loved by someone in one form and not the other.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Anyone who thinks that all there is to you is a flirtatious jokester is missing the big picture. You're kind and you look out for everyone. I'm just some civilian girl but whenever I'm in trouble, you make sure I'm safe before even thinking about taking on the enemy. You're a gentleman who would never, ever cross boundaries without permission and I bet Ladybug couldn't ask for a better, more loyal partner than you." Glancing away, she questioned if she was being a bit too specific.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"At least, that's what I've seen. I admire how carefree you are while still doing your best for others. I would have thought lots of girls would be interested in you. But, I guess most people don't look beyond the surface." A sombre look curved the corners of her lips downward. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Whoever you are without that mask, well....I don't think your status matters. If everyone loves you for such a superficial reason then, it's better to find someone who loves you and doesn't care how popular you are. Those things aren't important. I'd rather be with somebody who genuinely cares about me than be with them for fame."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Setting her bag down beneath her desk, she sighed. "I think Ladybug cares about you a lot. Maybe she's just so caught up in her feelings for Adrien that she doesn't want to believe that she wants to go on that date with you." That was a confession in itself but, he wouldn't know. He had no idea who Ladybug really was.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"If you saw who I am, I bet your thoughts would change." Chat Noir thought and then realised he said it out loud. Biting his lip and actually blushing, he looked her in the eye.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Can... can I show you? Who I am Marinette? I mean, then you'd be able to judge. I know you and I know how are. I can tell." He told her and actually began to slowly move his hand to his mask, just as he touched it, he stopped.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"No.. I can't tell you. It's against the rules that Ladybug set." He looked down. "It would not be safe for you." He stood up and looked to the window. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I should go. I shouldn't have bothered you with this." </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Chat Noir was getting embarrassed, getting shy, he was worried that he'd be putting her in danger, it was silly of him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He put his hand to his staff and looked at it. "Oh.. Ladybug is calling, I have to go." He lied, it was obviously not ringing and Ladybug wasn't calling because she was in front of him.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He turned to go for her balcony window.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"NO, it's okay!" Before he could leave, she placed her hand on his shoulder. "I told you that you could stay and I know Ladybug isn't calling for you." Her eyes widened in horror as she'd just said that out loud. There was no way he could've missed that one. How could she even cover that up?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Pulling her hand back, she took a few steps backward. "Uh...I'm not dumb. I know when you're lying. I don't think it's a bad thing that you trust me, Chat Noir. I could never betray you but I understand that you want to obey Ladybug. She made it clear in several interviews that the whole secret identity thing is to keep everyone safe."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Her nervous frown had become a soft smile. "And I'm sure that no matter who you are, you're amazing because you're you and not because you're well known. At least, that's how I fee." He seemed so eager to leave and take back everything he'd gotten off his chest but, running away wasn't like him. He'd always tried to push Ladybug to be outward with him so, Marinette couldn't let him run. He'd regret it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"You don't have to show me who you are but, I don't think you should be alone right now."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I..." He looked down when she stopped him, turning to face her as she put he hand on his shoulder, placing his on her's just as she pulled it back.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"I... guess you're right." He nodded. Looking down. "Do you... think you can get me a glass of water? I.. I wont leave. I'll stay here." He told her softly.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If she said yes and if she left to go get it, Chat Noir would stand looking into her mirror, taking a deep breath, he took off his mask and placed it on the table. He knew Ladybug would kill him for this, he knew Plagg would yell at him, which was why he wasn't transforming back, simply taking his mask off.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If she left and then returned, he would turn around just as she came in, revealing his face, revealing his identity, although his hair was still that mix of gel and messy, he was clearly Adrien Agreste.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Hey Marinette..." He smiled softly at her.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
